# 🔄 Nutstore Sync

[English](docs/en.md) | [简体中文](docs/zh.md)

This plugin enables two-way synchronization between Obsidian notes and Nutstore (坚果云) via WebDAV protocol.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Two-way Sync Algorithm**: Keep notes in sync across devices
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: No need to manually input WebDAV server address, account, and keys - just authorize and go
- **Remote Folder Selection Tool**: Choose remote folders through a graphical interface to avoid manual input errors
- **Smart Conflict Resolution**:
  - Auto-merge algorithm: Automatically merges changed files through character-level comparison for seamless multi-client sync
  - When automatic merging is not possible, file contents are annotated for manual conflict resolution

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- ⏳ Initial sync may take longer (especially with many files)
- 💾 Backing up important notes before syncing is recommended
